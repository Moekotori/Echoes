## Overview

ECHO is a cross-platform desktop music player focused on audio quality, extensibility, and a clean listening experience. It provides a native audio pipeline for high-fidelity local playback, an integrated lyrics system, MV playback via YouTube and Bilibili, and a plugin architecture for extending core functionality.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | >= 18 |
| npm | >= 9 |
| Electron | 31.x (managed by devDependencies) |

> Windows is the primary development and test target. macOS and Linux builds are supported but not continuously validated.
>
> For the smoothest local development experience with native dependencies such as `naudiodon`, use Node.js 20 LTS.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moekotori/Echoes.git
cd Echoes
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If you are developing from mainland China, this repository includes a project-local `.npmrc` that points package installation to a domestic registry mirror and Node.js headers to the Tsinghua Tuna mirror.

Native modules (`naudiodon`) are compiled automatically via `electron-builder install-app-deps` in the `postinstall` hook.

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This launches the Electron app with hot-reload via `electron-vite`.

---

## Building

### Windows

```bash
npm run build:win
```

Produces a distributable NSIS installer under `dist/`.

### Windows (Release with auto-update artifacts)

```bash
npm run build:win:release
```

Outputs to `release/` including the `.blockmap` and `latest.yml` required by `electron-updater`.

### macOS

```bash
npm run build:mac
```

### Linux

```bash
npm run build:linux
```

---

## Testing

Run the lightweight unit regression suite:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Before a release build, run:

```bash
npm run verify:release
```

See [`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) for the full release gate and smoke flow.

---

## Listen Together Server

The optional server enables synchronized co-listening sessions.

```bash
cd server/listen-together
npm install
PORT=8787 npm start
```

For production deployment with Nginx reverse proxy and PM2, see [`server/listen-together/DEPLOY_FROM_ZERO_ZH.md`](server/listen-together/DEPLOY_FROM_ZERO_ZH.md).

---

## Plugin Development

Plugins are placed in the user's plugin directory and loaded at startup. Each plugin is a folder containing a `plugin.json` manifest and optional `main.js` (Node.js sandbox), `renderer.js`, and `styles.css` files.

For the full API reference and manifest specification, see [`docs/plugin-development.md`](docs/plugin-development.md).

Example plugins are provided in [`examples/`](examples/).
